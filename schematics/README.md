# Push Push schematics

In this folder there are 2 examples: one for 2 buttons connected, the other for 5 buttons.

But really there's nothing hard: simply connect your pushbutton to GND and to a digital pin. 

The schematics are made with the open source software [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) so you can open them without any cost.

There is a **pdf** version of the schematics too, if you need only to look at them without modify them.
